      <p>We're demons of course! Don't be alarmed by that we aren't as bad as your movies make us out to be. Honestly it really is incredibly offensive that we're almost always portrayed as these cartoonish villains who want to trick mortals out of their souls. Only <em>some</em> of us are like that, but most are like Deryl.</p>

        <p>Oh there's Deryl now! About to greet a new customer? Good work Deryl!! </p> <br> <br>
        <p>Here at SINS INC we appreciate all of our <em>customers</em> and employees who make our work so much more FUN</p>
